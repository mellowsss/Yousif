# Yousif's Projects

This repository hosts a few small front-end projects. The newest addition is a Spotify stats page that shows your top tracks and artists. To use it you need a Spotify developer account.

## Spotify Setup
1. Create a Spotify developer application at [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/).
2. Add `http://localhost/spotify.html` (or the path where you open `spotify.html`) as a redirect URI in your app settings.
3. Copy your **Client ID** and replace the `YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` placeholder in `spotify.js`.
4. Open `spotify.html` in your browser and log in with Spotify when prompted.

The page lets you view your top tracks or artists over different time ranges and uses a simple vibrant theme.
